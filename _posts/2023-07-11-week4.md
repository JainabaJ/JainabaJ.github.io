This week, the cross-validation I had implemented for sources from earlier weeks proved to be successful after making some adjustments. Specifically, modifications were made, and the graduate students were able to navigate through the process seamlessly.

In anticipation of community research, we took our preparations online, focusing on a comprehensive examination of organizations in the Seattle area. Our efforts extended to refining the list of potential partners, ensuring that for our upcoming meetings with these groups, we have our mission clearly articulated. It's crucial for us to be well-prepared to foster a productive partnership where we not only collect valuable data but also ensure that the community benefits from the collaboration.

Additionally, this week, we delved into exploring ways in which academic endeavors can impact communities or community members negatively during the data collection process. This reflective examination is vital in ensuring that our research practices are not inadvertently causing harm and that we approach our community engagement with sensitivity and awareness of potential pitfalls. This heightened awareness aligns with our commitment to fostering a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the communities we engage with.
