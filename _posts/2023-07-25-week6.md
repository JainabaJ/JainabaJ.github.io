This week, our attention was devoted to the intricate logistics of the community research group. We delved into thought-provoking questions, exploring the potential of community accountability boards as instruments for fostering accountable action and transparency within the realm of culturally competent human-centered technologies. It's a dynamic inquiry that seeks to enhance the intersection of technology and culture.

In parallel, we pondered over the collaborative and participatory approaches that researchers, both from academia and industry, could adopt when engaging with African American community members. The focal point here is addressing the unique challenges encountered by African American English (AAE) speakers in their interactions with voice technology. This demands a nuanced understanding of the cultural nuances and linguistic intricacies involved.

Our envisioned research methods align with a holistic approach, embracing Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPR), focus groups, and qualitative techniques such as interviewing, observations, and surveying. These methodologies are not just tools; they are the means through which we aim to cultivate a profound understanding of the community's needs and challenges, fostering a collaborative environment that prioritizes inclusivity and cultural sensitivity.
