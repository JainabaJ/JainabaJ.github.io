title: Week 3

This week proved to be relatively shorter, allowing me to delve further into the scoping literature review. Simultaneously, our focus shifted towards the meticulous planning of community-based research initiatives. Notably, Jay was absent from the office during this period.

Collaborating closely with PhD students, I dedicated significant efforts to refining and validating inclusion criteria extracted from sourced papers. However, I encountered some unexpected inconsistencies in the cross-validation process, primarily due to the unexpectedly high volume of papers in the scoping literature review. This prompted me to revisit and fine-tune my cross-validation approach for more robust results.

My engagement with the community board continued as well. Working alongside fellow research assistants, we actively addressed logistical considerations for the board. This involved extensive research to identify and connect with black organizations in the greater Seattle area that would be receptive to our collaborative endeavors. The intricacies of navigating this aspect underscored the importance of thorough planning and strategic outreach to ensure the success of our community engagement initiatives.
