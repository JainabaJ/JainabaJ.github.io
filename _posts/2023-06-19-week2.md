title: Week 2
---
This was the first week of the summer research in which we discussed community-based research and explored potential survey efforts set to launch in a month. The survey's design was influenced by the previous week's planning. Our focus was on collecting pertinent data aligned with our research objectives, especially in the realm of Automated Speech Recognition.

I was able to understand that African American speech is not found in high rates in speech corpora used for creating automated speech recognition. I also was tasked with creating a process for validating inclusion criteria from sourced papers and implementing a cross-validation process with PhD student collaborators for ensured transparency. Ideally, a form or checkboxes complemented with validating questions based on the inclusion criteria and research questions.
