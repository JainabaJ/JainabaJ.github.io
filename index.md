## About Me

I'm a senior at the University of Washington passionate about using data to make a positive impact on human health and address complex societal challenges. I believe data science can drive social change, promoting equity, sustainability, and inclusion. By uncovering insights and informing decision-making, we can build a more just society. I'm excited to contribute my skills to projects aligned with these values. If you're looking for a dedicated data scientist who shares a commitment to making a difference, let's connect and explore opportunities to create lasting positive change together.

## About My Mentor

I am working with Jay Cunningham at the University of Washington in the field of Human-Centered Design and Engineering. Jay's research specifically explores the dynamic intersections among society, AI/ML technology, equity, and innovation. This focus allows us to delve into the complex relationships between these areas and uncover valuable insights that can drive positive change. 

## About My Project

My project aims to address racial disparities and fairness-related harms in automated speech recognition (ASR) and language technologies specifically for African-American speakers of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). To promote equity and inclusivity in these technologies, the project adopts community-based approaches. The study design includes community-based participatory research, surveying, and conducting semi-structured interviews. The research primarily focuses on conducting a scoping literature review and thematic analysis to explore inclusive approaches for collecting representative speech data from African-American English speakers in ASR and natural language processing. Key areas of inquiry involve examining how researchers in human-computer interaction (HCI), machine learning/natural language processing (ML/NLP), and linguistics discuss and address bias in ASR for Black speakers, as well as exploring practices related to data curation, collection, validation, and ownership for designing inclusive ASR/NLP systems. Additionally, the project seeks to identify various approaches, methods, theories, and practical recommendations that contribute to the design of more inclusive ASR/NLP systems specifically for AAVE speakers.
